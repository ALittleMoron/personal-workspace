# My Site Frontend

In the full application stack, infrastructure nginx remains the public edge proxy:

- `/` is proxied to the frontend Node.js SSR container.
- `/api/*` is proxied to the backend service.
- `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` are proxied to backend-generated discovery endpoints.
- TLS, public domains, MinIO, and backup UI routing stay in the infrastructure layer.

## Development server

Use Node.js 24.16.0 for local frontend commands (`.nvmrc` matches CI). The production Docker
image uses its own pinned Node.js runtime documented below.

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

Frontend Make targets prepare npm dependencies automatically when `node_modules` is missing or stale.

```bash
make build
```

The production build is written to `dist/my-site-frontend/browser`.

```bash
make ssr-smoke
```

To build the production SSR bundle and run strict Lighthouse CI quality and performance gates for
the public SSR/CSR route sample, run:

```bash
make lighthouse
```

Reports are written to `performance/reports/lighthouse/`.

## Docker image

Build the frontend image from this directory:

```bash
docker build -t "my_site_frontend:${IMAGE_TAG:?set IMAGE_TAG}" .
```

The image uses:

- `node:26.4.0-alpine` to install dependencies and run the Angular production build.
- `node:26.4.0-alpine` as the production runtime for `dist/my-site-frontend/server/server.mjs`.
- Production dependencies are installed in the runtime stage, then npm/npx and the npm cache are removed from the final image because the server runtime only needs `node`.
- Explicit runtime environment: `PORT`, `SSR_API_ORIGIN`, `APP_URL_SCHEMA`, `APP_DOMAIN`, and optionally `SSR_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` / `NG_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

## Repository split boundary

This directory is intended to become a standalone frontend repository later. Frontend-owned files should stay here, including Angular source code, public assets, the frontend Dockerfile, and the Angular SSR runtime entrypoint.

The frontend should not own TLS, public domain routing, backend proxy rules, sitemap/robots routing, MinIO routing, or backup service routing. Those belong to the infrastructure repository.

## Running unit tests

```bash
make test
```

## Linting

```bash
make lint
```
